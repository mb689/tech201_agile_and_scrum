- Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. 
- DevOps is an approach to software development that enables teams to build, test, and release software faster and more reliably by incorporating agile principles and practices, such as increased automation and improved collaboration between development and operations teams.
- Scrum helps people and teams deliver value incrementally in a collaborative manner. If you are just getting started, think of it as a way to get work done as a team in small pieces at a time, with experimentation and feedback loops along the way.
